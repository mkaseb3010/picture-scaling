This is a small program I made that takes an image and you can scale/zoom and move around 
as you like.

**Usage:**
You will be prompted to first upload or take a picture of anything it can be. And then you will
be able to see the coordinates and details of the image on the bottom left of the screen.

Place two fingers to scale the image bigger or smaller. 

Double tap a picture to instantly make it bigger or smaller.

Dont worry about the image size you upload to the program, the program will automatically resize the image
to the default pixels required to run.

This is programmed with android studio, in the case you face compatibility issues keep in mind the versions 
I am running for this program.

The gradle version I am running is 8.7

And the following agp versions are:
        agp_version = '8.2.2'
        agp_version1 = '8.5.0'

**Important:**
You will be automatically presented with an error in file PaintPanel.java.66, you will be required to place your
image there.

This program works best with a physical android phone, emulators are not recommended.
